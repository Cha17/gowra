## üö® Critical Notes

### Before Starting Implementation

1. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure original server remains untouched
2. **Environment Variables**: Prepare all necessary secrets and configuration
3. **Database Access**: Verify Neon DB connection strings and permissions
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive testing approach
5. **Rollback Plan**: Have immediate fallback strategy ready

### During Implementation

1. **Incremental Progress**: Complete each phase fully before moving to next
2. **Testing**: Test each component thoroughly before integration
3. **Documentation**: Keep notes of any deviations from plan
4. **Validation**: Verify compatibility at each step
5. **Performance**: Monitor Worker limits and performance

### After Implementation

1. **Parallel Running**: Run both systems in parallel initially
2. **Gradual Migration**: Gradually shift traffic to Worker
3. **Monitoring**: Close monitoring during initial deployment
4. **Performance Tracking**: Compare metrics with original system
5. **Cleanup**: Archive original server only after full validation
